Today I attended a wonderful children's party. It took place in the book supermarket "Bukvitsa" (Khreshchatyk City shopping center)

The hostess of the holiday, director Natalya Sergeevna, ran around and directed the holiday. I was invited to evaluate the children’s work based on the works of Valentin Kovalenko “Vovchik” and Grigory Bilous “The Cunning Little Ones”. Two age categories: 5-7 grade and 8 grade. And be on the jury of the Literary Hero costume competition.

There were a lot of people. The children read poems by Ukrainian classics.

Then there was a parade of costumes and their presentation

The children met the famous Ukrainian writer Ivan Andrusyak. I also took advantage of the moment and asked for an autograph. I think that when my little son Mishutka grows up, he will be pleased.

There were many competitions: a reading competition, a children's illustration competition, a literary hero competition, a literary quest, a competition for the best reader of children's libraries, and an award for the best librarian in the city.
