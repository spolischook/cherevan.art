## X INTERNATIONAL UNDERWATER IMAGE FESTIVAL "SILVER SHARK"

April 22 â€“ 25, 2010

The Silver Shark Festival is a unique event in the cultural life of Ukraine, which brings together hundreds of participants (underwater photographers, directors, cameramen, producers, artists and sculptors) from different parts of the world and thousands of visitors - those who love the sea and want to learn more about depths of the World Ocean. The festival not only introduces the best creative works on underwater themes, but also draws attention to the environmental problems of the modern world.

Andre Laban (engineer, operator of the Cousteau team, worked for Calypso for 20 years, paints underwater);
Daniel Mercier (President of the World Festival of Underwater Imagery in France, founder of the CEDIP/UDIP diving training system);
Christian Petron (founder of Cinemarine, cameraman for underwater filming of the Discovery TV channel, the documentary film "Titanic", who together with Luc Besson directed the film "Abyss Blue").

Cockroaches many thousands of years ago. Thanks to archaeologists and those who restore rare specimens piece by piece, we can see this :)

Grand Prix for the best photograph. Fish from the Indonesian Sea. When they grow up, they change color and their wonderful spots are not visible. They are very difficult to catch to photograph. But the photographer succeeded.

My postcards. And the work of my student Maria Trofimova (11 years old), she is also a participant in the festival
