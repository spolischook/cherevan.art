In the gallery "Dim Mikoli" (Palace of Youth, I. Mazepy St., 13th metro station "Arsenalna") from 14.02 to 22.02 the exhibition "Inner map" will be held. The inner worlds of very different artists are united by the Trypillian past, modern and future. And if last year the presentation exhibition of an artistic group of latent ethnic groups proved the futility of seemingly real existence, forcing the viewer to look into the world of the unreal through a hundred kaleidoscopes, then this year the artists will offer a journey into the inner world of the group, providing the traveler with a map and several means of transportation. Although everyone will be able to use their own internal airship. Taking part: Sergey Kozachenko (graphics), Alexey Palenko (photo), Anna Pelykh (masks and art objects), Olga Sokurenko (painting), Tatyana Cherevan (graphics), Alexander Duvinsky (art objects), Vladimir Babchenko (painting) , Yaroslav Mogilev (painting), Jurko Koval (painting) and special guest from Serbia Zdur Bobic.
Opening on February 14 at 16.00. V. Solyanik plays.
