This year we were all blessed with wonderful weather. Wonderful, blessed ethno-festival "Tripillian Dawns". This is exactly the kind of event our city has been waiting for a long time. I like to see people gathering on the banks of the Dnieper, walking around the fair, listening to music, relaxing). As a participant, I will say that there were many people from other cities who asked how old the festival was and tried to buy something to remember it. My family and I enjoyed spending this weekend at the festival). I would like more artists from other regions to come to us at fairs and it would be more eventful and more diverse. We have enough space for everyone)
