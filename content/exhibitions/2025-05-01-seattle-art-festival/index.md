I am pleased to announce my participation in the **Seattle Erotic Art Festival 2025**!

This year, the festival will take place on **May 2, 3, & 4, 2025**. The location is **Seattle Center’s Exhibition Hall**, situated at **301 Mercer Street, Seattle, WA 98109**.

The Seattle Erotic Art Festival is an **international event** that has **showcased erotic art in all its forms for over 20 years**, including painting, photography, performance, poetry, and film. It's a **unique platform that brings together artists from around the world**, creating space for the **free expression of the body, sensuality, and artistic freedom**. Additionally, the festival features interactive and large-scale art, a silent film showcase, and even a special "Library" for lovers of literature.

It is a **great honor for me to represent Ukraine** at this powerful event and to participate in the dialogue about art and corporeality.

In my works, I often use materials such as **oil, acrylic, and gold leaf**, exploring themes that reflect the depth of emotions and sensuality. My piece "Soul's Touch," for example, uses oil, acrylic, and gold leaf on canvas.

I invite you to immerse yourselves in the world of erotic art and visit the festival!
