A look at the holiday from the participants.

Itâ€™s impossible to cover everything; this is only a small part of the holiday.

Today the residents of our city dressed in beautiful embroidered shirts. Everyone gathered in the Valley of Roses. They organized a grand fair, which attracted participants from all areas of the region.

Sofia Rataru's voice brightened the holiday and was a big surprise for many!

At the end there was a huge fireworks display.
