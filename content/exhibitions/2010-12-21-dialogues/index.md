This week the exhibition “Dialogues” opened at the Cherkasy Art Museum. She gathered talented youth not only from Cherkassy, but also from all over Ukraine. I was very pleased with the new names, as well as the originality and spontaneity of the works presented. Congratulations to my friends, exhibitors Marina Denisenko (painting) and Svetlana Tikhomirova (photography).
