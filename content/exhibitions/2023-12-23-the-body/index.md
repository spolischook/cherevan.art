Curator: Natalya Kostyrko  
"The Body" project brings together artists whose artworks are united by the eternal theme of the human body. The body can express emotion and the artist's vision of beauty, as in paintings by Nicasio Torres; or give the viewer an erotic mood, as in the etudes byAndriy Babchinsky; or reveal fantasies, as in the artworks by Nina Murashkina. Female sexuality is interpreted as a part of nature in art pieces by Javier Garces, and in the sculpture of Xavier Escala, the body becomes a precious container for the person's inner world. Exploring your's and your partner's body could be the way for self-understanding, as in Tetyana Cherevan's works. Technical accuracy and a deep understanding of the human body's plasticity will make you fall in love with the art of Ivan Pidhainy. Invites you to explore various views on corporeality and to get inspired by the artistic vision of beauty, sensuality and eroticism.
