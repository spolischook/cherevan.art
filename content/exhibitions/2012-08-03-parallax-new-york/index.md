In August, the Parallax Art Fair NYC exhibition of contemporary art will take place in New York.

I will be participating in the Pralax exhibition for the first time. People ask me how I got there. Dr. Chris Barlow sent an invitation by mail to try to participate in the exhibition. To do this, you had to send your paintings by email to participate in the competitive selection. I chose two paintings from the latest series of works "Totem". No one has ever seen these paintings in Ukraine. I sent them to the competition in America with trepidation. A month later I received a notification that my work had been selected!

The emigrant Diana helped me in organizing the shipment and delivery of paintings to the exhibition. We met her on social networks and had never seen each other. It is very nice to have such good friends.

Two of my paintings have already crossed the border and are waiting, like before a ball - a show behind the scenes)

There will be about 200 artists from all over the world at the exhibition!

Curated by Dr. Chris Barlow.

Parallax AF, or P(AF), will make its NYC debut at the esteemed event venue, 82 Mercer. Through being a direct art-to-consumer experience with an open admission policy, P(AF) makes a uniquely refreshing conceptual statement about subjectivity and the commoditization of taste. Creator and curator Dr. Chris Barlow says: “Parallax offers an intellectual framework that encourages risk to buy what you actually like for a change—there is nothing worse than making a purchase you like and some ‘specialist’ sneering down their nose at you.”

This is the first art fair with such a democratic nature and its NYC appearance will be the franchise’s fifth edition. The event attracts around 200 artists from all over the world, presenting 2,000 to 3,000 pieces. The loose “mosaic” approach to curating P(AF) befits its irreverence for the stiffness of traditional exhibitions and is conceptually in line with the event’s spirited accessibility. The art spans the spectrum in content, style, and abilities due to the level playing field of P(AF)’s universal acceptance, ensuring established and emerging artists are equally represented.
