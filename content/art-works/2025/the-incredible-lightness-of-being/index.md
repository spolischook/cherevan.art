It’s about the quiet tenderness that blossoms between two people. About the fear of touching someone, afraid of scaring away fragile feelings, like a delicate butterfly, and about the search for a key — not only to the other, but also to oneself.

The garden in this painting reflects the inner worlds of the heroines. Their emotions intertwine with the flowers and the fragility of a moment where time seems to stand still. The butterfly flutters, leaving behind a sense that the search for the key continues, but the process itself is already part of the beauty of being.
