The depiction of a woman with the head of a parrot holding a rope suggests strong volitional control in the context of sexual energy, defining subjectivity and self-actualization in her own sexual preferences. It symbolizes an individual process of liberation from societal stereotypes and even sexual taboos through active self-expression and defining personal boundaries.

The mythological aspect of this image can evoke the imagery of personal transformation and self-definition, where the parrot, situated beyond the confines of the cage, becomes an embodiment of a sense of individuality and freedom. From this perspective, the erotic portrayal of the parrot serves as a weaving not only of sexuality but also of emancipation, independence, and liberation from societal norms.

In this piece of art, a woman with the head of a parrot holding a rope is depicted. Her body is intricately woven into beautiful shibari patterns, and the sparkling feathers on her head add uniqueness. Luxurious red peonies blossoming on her body create an impression of beauty and vitality.

However, a crucial element is the inscription «free» on her hand, giving this artwork a deeper meaning. It is not just an image; it is an expression of personal will and liberation from constraints. Every detail of this artistic creation interacts, forming an image that impresses with its uniqueness and symbolism.
