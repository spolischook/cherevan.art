I work in the genres of graphics, painting, and sculpture. Throughout my life, I have explored the theme of sexual orientation, which was hidden and prohibited by the Soviet authorities in Ukraine.  

Female figures occupy a central place in my art. I explore women, their existence, and their role in society. The woman, as I see her, is a symbol of life and faith that evokes a more aesthetic perception of the world and conduces to a deeper connection with other people. In my works, I create an image of a woman that reflects her dreams and illusions, which save and inspire her soul.  

In my art, I convey emotions and feelings evoked by the world around me. My art is based on revealing topics that have recently been considered taboos, such as sexual orientation, bondage, homosexuality, etc. I try to encourage viewers to be excited, captivated, and even shocked by my works, inducing deep emotions and unleashing their imagination. This increases awareness and understanding that our ideas about "the normal" might be reduced and need to be reconsidered.  

I give priority to female images in my art, exploring various aspects of female life and self-identification. The woman is not only a symbol of life and faith, yet a practical and real entity who encounters miscellaneous challenges, such as injustice, discrimination, violence, and whatnot. I create images of women with their dreams, illusions, and desires, as well as explore their psychology to reproduce their essence in my works.
